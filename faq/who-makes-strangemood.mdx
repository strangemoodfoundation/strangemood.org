question: "Who's writing this? Who makes this?"

Oh, I'm Evan, hi! I hope your world's going well.

Strangemood is made by the Rebase Foundation, which _is_ a company (sort of). I know, another confusingly named organization you've never heard of. Rebase is a little research lab that makes automated co-ops and then becomes a member of the co-ops.

A lot of folks are trying to automate away the worker; the Rebase Foundation automates away the owner. We spin up competitors to existing companies as automated co-ops & protocols, and split it between the customer, the worker, and the vendors. That makes prices go down and wages go up, making everyone richer.

We're pretty sure this is the point of crypto and anyone who's not trying to do this has their head on backwards. If you're into increasing prosperity for more people, like thinking about incentives, and have a properly aligned head, come join us.
