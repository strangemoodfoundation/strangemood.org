question: "Is this 'games as NFTs'?"

No, not really. The protocol supports NFT games, because the protocol doesn't explicitly have anything to do with NFTs. It's like how email supports drinking a cup of orange juice in the morning because those silly folks on ARPANET never explicitly prevented drinking orange juice in the morning in their protocol.

Strangemood is setup to allow you to buy and sell non-transferable software licenses. It does not use NFTs, but it does issue a traditional token to a token account that's frozen upon purchase.
