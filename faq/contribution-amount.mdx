question: "Why 1% contribution rate?"

Well, to some extent you just gotta pick a number to start with. Because the number is controllable by the co-op, it doesn't really matter what number you start with. If it's too high or too low, the co-op has the power to fix it. But we tried to pick something that was low enough that it was competitive with other marketplaces, and high enough that it could pay for unknown expenses.

As the marketplace gets bigger, it's likely that the contribution rate will get pushed down quite significantly.
