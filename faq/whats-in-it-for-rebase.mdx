question: "What's in it for Rebase?"
---

The same thing that's in it for the other members of the co-op. If you take Steam's revenue, split it beteween the ecosystem and the game developers, then you make money by building the ecosystem and games.

Rebase creates Strangemood, and ends up with about 5% or less voting power in the co-op, and becomes one of many ecosystem vendors to the co-op. If the rest of the co-op doesn't like Rebase, it can always stop paying Rebase, or just start it's own co-op.

Because the vast majority of the voting power of the co-op is in the hands of not-Rebase, Rebase can (probably) not become a centralized power on the network. In other words, Rebase needs to compete to provide reasonable goods and services on an open market.
