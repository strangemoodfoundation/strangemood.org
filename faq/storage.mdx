question: "What about storage?"
---

Strangemood is "storage-agnostic". In other words, it doesn't matter where the user gets the game _from_, the protocol only handles the licensing and sale part.

The game developer can distribute the game themselves if they'd like, though we recommend using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). We're going to run an "at-cost" [IPFS pinning service](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/), paid for by the co-op, that keeps games around.
