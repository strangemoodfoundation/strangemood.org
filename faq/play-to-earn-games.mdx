question: "Is this 'Steam for play to earn games'?"

No, it's a marketplace to buy and sell games. You can put a play-to-earn game on the Strangemood protocol, it's unlikely anyone will stop you. But Strangemood isn't explicitly for any type of game.

Actually, Strangemood isn't even necessarily for games. It's a decentralized app store. But Apple and Google are picky about you creating another store on their devices, and so most software licenses are for video games.
