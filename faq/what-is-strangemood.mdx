**It's a protocol!** Strangemood is a collection of open protocols for buying and selling software licenses on the internet. You can use Strangemood to start _your own_ game or app store, that will interop with every other store built on Strangemood.

**It's a co-op!** Strangemood funds development, servers, and other expenses via a co-op called the Strangemood Foundation. A portion of every sale goes to a community token account on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain, that's collectively controlled by ecosystem developers and the sellers on the store.

**Get a grant!** As an ecosystem developer, you can receive voting tokens in the network, as well as SOL grants to fund your development. At the moment, the best way to do this is to just tell us what you're doing in [the Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Y2R3VBcRmA), but we're working on a more formal grant program.
