question: "Can you explain more about what community funds go to?"

The primary purpose is to fund public goods and expenses in running the protocol. A public good is something that doesn't have a clear business model, like open source libraries or indexes of games. In other words, the community can "hire" maintainers of the protocol (like Rebase), or help kick start ecosystem projects.

The secondary purpose is to prevent the "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy. This is a strategy where a corporation adopts an open source protocol, adds extra features, and then it becomes impossible to use the protocol without using that company's "version" of it.

In the past, a protocol has no way of competing, because the protocol doesn't have a long-term funding model to match the corporation. Building in a community account allows for the protocol itself to be competitive with corporations. But because Strangemood is controlled, in majority share, by game developers, they can prevent it from charging any more than is necessary to fund development and maintenance. And because it's controlled in minority share by ecosystem projects, who can receive SOL grants from the protocol, they are still incentivized to make the protocol useful and good.
