question: "Does Strangemood make a profit?"
---

No. Strangemood is a protocol. If you and your friends got together to plan a party, and you wrote down all the things you'd need to get at the store on a piece of paper, did the piece of paper make a profit?

The money in Strangemood flows to game developers and folks that build the ecosystem that supports Strangemood.

This is hard for people to wrap their brain around, because it's the really the "new thing" that blockchains provide: escrows without a third party. Everything else in crypto, from currencies to DAOs, is a derivative of that concept.

When you buy a game on Steam, you're buying from Steam. Steam takes the money, holds the cash and the game in a sort of "escrow", and then it gives some money to the game developer and gives you the game. But when you buy a game on Strangemood, you're buying from _the game developer_. A little bit of money is also going to the storage provider, the folks that make the website, and all the other "expenses" that are needed to run the network. But you're also paying those people _directly_.
