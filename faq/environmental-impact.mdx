About the same as this website. In other words, almost nothing. A single transaction on the Solana blockchain [uses about as much energy as a google search.](https://solana.com/news/solana-energy-usage-report-november-2021)

## What can I do about climate change broadly?

Well, this is a weird place to ask, but sure, I'll bite.

If you, like us, care about climate change, we'd recommend you offset your personal emissions with a service like [wren.co](https://www.wren.co/), encourage your local leaders to support car-free alternatives (like bike lanes, busses, trains, and walkable neighborhoods), encourage your college-aged friends to go into STEM fields to investigate alternatives to steel and cement, support the space industry's attempts to do off-planet manufacturing and mining if it turns out steel and cement alternatives are a no-go, and if you live in Arkansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming or Montana, call your representative in support of cultivated meat and seafood. If you live in the US, your town likely bans climate-friendly housing; consider joining movements like [YIMBY action](https://yimbyaction.org/) in making it legal to build cheap, low carbon-footprint buildings and neighborhoods. When you get the opportunity, pick the veggie option, the electric heater, the denser neighborhood, or the elected representative that values being a good ancestor.
