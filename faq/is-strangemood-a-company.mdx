No, it's a _protocol_.

## Wait, I thought Strangemood is a co-op?

Okay, fine, you got me. The Strangemood _protocol_ puts money into a _co-op_'s token account upon purchase.

Every game on Strangemood (or "listing") belongs to a co-op. When someone sells a game, that goes into a community treasury controlled by the co-op. The co-op is made up of that particular group of people.

The initial co-op is called "the Strangemood Foundation" and is made up of everyone who's selling on the network, and the ecosystem projects that support them.
