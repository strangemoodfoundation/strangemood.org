question: "What do you mean 'anyone can create a store'?"
category: "basics"

When you list a game on Strangemood, you list it on _a blockchain_, not on a specific store. Anyone with a bit of programming knowledge can write code that reads from the chain, and with the permission of your cryptowallet, can create a new listing on the chain.

For players, that means you can buy the game anywhere, and it will appear in your wallet. For game developers, that means you can list your game anywhere and it will show up on many stores at once.
