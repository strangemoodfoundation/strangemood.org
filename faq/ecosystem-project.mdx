question: "What's an ecosystem project?"
---

The "ecosystem" is made up of developers, designers, community managers, and so on who make marketplaces, software packages, back-office tools, wallet integrations, and other things useful to game developers.

They should be part of any healthy co-op. The Strangemood Foundation allocates 20% to 40% of the vote token distribution to ecosystem projects, and the rest to game developers.
