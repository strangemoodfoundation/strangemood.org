question: "Why do you keep saying 'co-op'? Isn't this a DAO?"

Yeah sure, but can _you_ explain what a DAO is to your parents? Look, more people have heard of co-ops than have heard of DAOs. NPR thinks DAOs are "investment vehicles" that are literally pronounced "D-A-O". If you're outside of crypto, you only see the ponzi schemes and Bitcoin's energy usage. Most people hear about crypto from a screenshot of a Twitter post on Instagram that tells them why "NFTs are bad for the environment", or from their weird cousin who whips out his Rainbow wallet at Thanksgiving to show you some pixel art.

Strangemood isn't a crypto project. It's just a co-op. Lots of people know what co-ops are. Let's hold hands and make a cyberpunk co-op.
