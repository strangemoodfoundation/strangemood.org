question: "Why would there be multiple co-ops?"

Imagine you're participating in the Strangemood Foundation, and 60% of members want to do `HORRIBLE_AWFUL_THING`. Now you, a reasonable, sane, person; literally an actual angel decended from heaven, could not possibly continue with this co-op. After all, they want to do `HORRIBLE_AWFUL_THING`!

You, and the other 40% of people can just setup your own co-op, move your games over, and say "respectfully, peace out" to the other 60%.

But you can continue to use the _same_ Strangemood protocol without needing to make a code change or redeploy the program. So all the apps you're using can continue to work, for the same reason that your browser will continue to work if you switch your website's hosting provider.

Because anyone can create a co-op, it prevents anyone from gaining 51% of the co-op and using it to raise fees. If that were to happen, developers could simply spin up a new co-op _without_ the person who controlled 51%.
