question: "Do I have to buy the games in SOL?"
---

No, you can buy the game with any currency, and the client can swap between your currency and SOL in the transaction using protocols like [Serum swap.](https://github.com/project-serum/swap) You can buy Strangemood games with ETH if you want. You can get from a fiat currency (like dollars) to crypto with a service like [Ramp Network](https://ramp.network). You'd still need a wallet, but that wallet just becomes your game library.
