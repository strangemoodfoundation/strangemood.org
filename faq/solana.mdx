question: "Why Solana?"

It's fast, environmentally efficient, and it works right now. It's fairly simple to build a bridge to other chains, so Strangemood can be accessed from _any_ chain. It doesn't matter which chain the data lives on. If for some reason _it does_ matter, then we'll just migrate onto that chain.
