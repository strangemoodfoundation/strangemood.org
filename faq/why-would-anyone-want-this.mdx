question: "Why would anyone want this?"

Lower fees, a bigger marketplace, and better user experience for game developers and players. Take Steam's revenue and split it between the game developers (as lower fees) and anyone with distribution (the marketplaces).

There's plenty of people with more distribution than Steam (Youtubers & Streamers notably) who currently are making less money than Steam. Take the cut that's going to Steam, give it to those folks instead, and split the difference.
