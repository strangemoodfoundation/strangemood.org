# Strangemood

**It's a protocol!** Strangemood is a collection of open protocols for buying and selling software licenses on the internet. You can use Strangemood to start _your own_ game or app store, that will interop with every other store built on Strangemood.

**It's a co-op!** Strangemood funds development, servers, and other expenses via a co-op called the Strangemood Foundation. A portion of every sale goes to a community token account on the Solana blockchain, that's collectively controlled by ecosystem developers and the sellers on the store.

**Get a grant!** As an ecosystem developer, you can receive voting stake in the network, as well as SOL grants to fund your development. At the moment, the best way to do this is to just tell us what you're doing in the Discord, but we're working on a more formal grant program.

## Why crypto? Why do you need a blockchain for this?

Well how would _you_ make a community treasury that's controlled by potentially millions of people. You could use a company; but that company would need to find a way to capture value, or the company would die.

Strangemood isn't "Steam but Blockchain lol"; blockchains are just the economic tool for the job.

## Why Solana?

It's fast, environmentally efficient, and it works right now. It's fairly simple to build a bridge, so Strangemood can be accessed from _any_ chain. It doesn't matter which chain the data lives on.

## Is this "games as NFTs"?

No, not really. The protocol supports NFT games, because the protocol doesn't explicitly have anything to do with NFTs. It's like how email supports drinking a cup of orange juice in the morning because those silly folks on ARPANET never explicitly prevented drinking orange juice in the morning.

Strangemood is setup to allow you to buy and sell non-transferable software licenses.

## Wait, then can you give me the a quick TL;DR of how the protocol works?

Strangemood is a program on the Solana blockchain. That program has "instructions". Let's just talk about two of them.

**InitListing** lets you create something for sale. You give it a price, an address of where you'd like the money to go, an address of where you'd like to get votes in the co-op when someone buys your listing, an address of the co-op that the listing belongs to.

```js
// This is a simplified version, the real one takes a few more things.
InitListing(
  price, // A amount of SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency
  sol_deposit, // A public key
  vote_deposit, // A public key
  co_op // A public key
);
```

**Huh, why is the _co-op_ an argument?** Because _anyone_ can make a co-op. Imagine you're participating in the Strangemood Foundation, and 60% of members want to do `HORRIBLE_AWFUL_THING`. Now you, a reasonable, sane, person; literally an actual angel decended from heaven, could not possibly continue with this co-op.

You and the other 40% have the power to setup your own co-op, without needing to fork the Strangemood program. Everything you'd need is open-source, easily deployable yourself.

Since the co-op controls the contribution amount (aka the "fees"), the ability to fork creates a "race-to-the-bottom" to find the lowest possible fees for the value provided. This ensures that the co-op is never a rent-seeker; if it becomes one, use a different co-op. The first co-op, the Strangemood Foundation, is already setup to have extremely low fees and to never make a profit.

**PurchaseListing** lets you buy a pre-existing listing. When this happens, the original lister gets minted votes in the protocol itself, proportional to the sale price.

```js
PurchaseListing(
  listing, // A public key of the listing
  token_account_to_purchase_with // the SOL to hand over
);
```

When you purchase a listing, you receive a token that represents the game. But since this is a software license, the game developer can decide to "freeze" that token immediately, making it a non-tranferable token.

Games can validate that the user owns that token, but can be ensured that they actually purchased it.

## What about storage?

Strangemood is "storage-agnostic". In other words, it doesn't matter where the user gets the game _from_,

## If Strangemood doesn't make a profit, then why create Strangemood, what's in it for you?

The same thing that's in it for you. The Strangemood Foundation, and the Strangemood protocol, is created by a real-world research lab called "Rebase" and it's currently acting as the primary maintainer.

In other words, Rebase is a _vendor_ to the co-op and gets paid to host and run servers. If the members of the co-op decide Rebase is bad at being a maintainer, they can simply vote to stop paying Rebase, and just hire another maintainer.

Since Rebase created the Strangemood Foundation, originally it starts with 100% of the voting power, or about 100,000 tokens. But it wouldn't be a co-op if Rebase owned a majority stake.

So initially, Rebase distributes 70,000 tokens to ecosystem projects and folks that help build the protocol with us. Another 200,000 tokens are distributed by the Strangemood protocol automatically, as game developers sell on the marketplace.

At that point, Rebase owns 10% and is no longer in control of the co-op. This ensures Rebase is aligned in the same interest as the co-op. However, if the co-op wishes, it can choose to inflate Rebase out of the picture, to hire a different maintainer, or to fork the entire thing and spin up their own co-op.

Rebase is a lab and we're running an experiment: can we rebuild significant portions of the economy as co-ops? We've been told that the computer age would automate away the worker; we're curious if we can automate away the owner. We think this would make _everyone_ richer.

## Wait, can you explain more about what community funds go to?

It's primary purpose is to fund public goods and expenses in running the protocol. A public good is something that doesn't have a clear business model, like open source libraries or indexes of games. In other words, the community can "hire" maintainers of the protocol (like Rebase), or help kick start ecosystem projects.

The secondary purpose is to prevent the "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy. This is a strategy where a corporation adopts an open source protocol, adds extra features, and then it becomes impossible to use the protocol without using that company's "version" of it.

In the past, the protocol has no way of competing, because the protocol doesn't have a long-term funding model to match the corporation. Building in a community account allows for the protocol itself to be competitive with corporations. But because Strangemood is controlled, in majority share, by game developers, they can prevent it from charging any more than is necessary to fund development and maintenance. And because it's controlled in minority share by ecosystem projects, who can receive SOL grants from the protocol, they are still incentivized to make the protocol useful and good.
