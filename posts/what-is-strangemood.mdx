## It’s an open source competitor to Steam.

Strangemood is a new way to sell video games on the internet, that, maybe, **can have a larger marketplace and lower fees than Steam.**

Unlike Steam, Strangemood isn't a single store; it's a network of stores that interoperate with each other. Instead of listing a game on _one_ store, you can list your game on "the network", and the game is available for any store to sell. It doesn't matter which store someone buys the game from, it still appears in their Strangemood library.

When you list your game for sale, you can pick a percentage of the sale to offer as a cut to the store that sold their game. For example, if you give 10% of a $30 game, the store would get $3.

Stores within the network may choose to only sell games that are above a minimum cut. So if a developer sets their percentage cut to be higher, they'll appear in more stores. However, if a store's minimum cut is too high, then other stores that accept lower cuts will get the sale instead.

Developers compete to increase the cut, stores compete to lower the cut. **The equilibrium is (maybe) lower than Steam’s current 25% to 30% per sale, with an equal or larger market size.**

## It’s like a co-op, owned by game developers.

In order to pay for the expenses of the network (like storage, tools, IP protection, and so on), a small percentage of every sale (currently 1%) goes to a community treasury. Votes that control that treasury are distributed to game developers every time they make a sale. Those votes also that contribution percentage, as well as all the rules of the network.

Since organizing potentially hundreds of thousands of game developers is really hard, developers may elect and un-elect representatives that can vote for them instead. Alternatively, a co-op might use a strategy like [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/) grants to pay for expenses.

If you don’t like your co-op, you can leave and start your own co-op within Strangemood that sets its rules, contribution rates, and expenses differently.

## How does Strangemood work?

Oh, it’s an open-source program on a carbon-neutral blockchain called Solana.

I know, I know, crypto, _oof!_ Fear not, Strangemood has no environmental impact, no relation to NFTs, and no ponzi-scheme. In fact, players don’t even to know that any crypto is involved at all; you can even buy games with a credit card if you want.

Crypto is just the plumbing. It's probably not the _only_ way to do this, but it’s the most reasonable. Whoever controls the network and its treasury is in the position to fleece game developers. So instead, Strangemood gives the network and the treasury to a program that no single entity controls, on a blockchain that no single entity controls.

## Who makes Strangemood?

Strangemood is made by Rebase, a little startup you’ve probably never heard of.

Initially Rebase controls 100% of the votes in the co-op. As folks sell games on Strangemood, the program automatically creates new votes and gives them to game developers, until eventually game developers own the majority stake of the network.

Rebase is a little economic lab. We spin up competitors to existing companies as automated co-ops & protocols, and split it between the customer, the worker, and the vendors. That makes prices go down and wages go up, making everyone richer. We're pretty sure this is the point of crypto and anyone who's not trying to do this has their head on backwards. If you're into increasing prosperity for more people, like thinking about incentives, and have a properly aligned head, come join us.
