# Getting Started

Strangemood is a decentralized marketplace for software licenses on the Solana blockchain. To interact with it from the browser, you'll need to use both Solana's javascript library, and Strangemood's javascript library.

```bash
npm install --save @strangemood/strangemood @solana/web3.js

# or

yarn add @strangemood/strangemood @solana/web3.js
```

## Putting something up for sale

To sell something on Strangemood, you need to create a `Listing`. A Listing is an "Account" on the Solana blockchain that contains:

- a price, in lamports
- the public key of the Token Account to deposit SOL into upon purchase
- the public key of the Token Account to deposit votes into upon purchase
- the public key of the "Realm" that represents the co-op
